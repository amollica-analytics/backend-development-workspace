# backend-development-workspace

**Name:** Anthony Mollica  

This repository serves as my digital notebook for backend development, including projects folders, learning logs, resources, and personal Git references. Each unit folder corresponds to a specific area of backend development:

- **unit-02-version-control** – Git workflows, commits, branches, and collaboration  
- **unit-03-backend-scripting** – Basic backend scripting exercises  
- **unit-04-advanced-scripting** – More complex scripting and automation  
- **unit-05-restful-apis** – RESTful API design and testing  

The workspace is designed to help me **stay organized, document progress, and build a structured learning environment** throughout the course.


## Learning Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of Git and version control workflows  
- Gain proficiency in backend scripting and command-line tools  
- Learn to design, develop, and test RESTful APIs  
- Improve code organization, readability, and maintainability  
- Develop a personal reference library for backend development concepts  

## How I Plan to Use This Repository

- Store all project files for each unit in their respective folders  
- Maintain a **learning log** to record goals, challenges, and insights (`learning-log.md`)  
- Collect useful backend resources in a single reference file (`resources.md`)  
- Build a **Git command cheat sheet** for quick reference (`git-reference.md`)  
- Use this repository as a **central hub** for reviewing material, tracking progress, and studying concepts throughout the semester
